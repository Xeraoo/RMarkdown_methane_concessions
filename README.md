# # Laboratory Report: Data Processing with R Markdown

## Project Overview
This project is a report from a laboratory class focused on scripting for data processing. It is based on **R Markdown**, a powerful tool designed for easy text formatting and integrating code within documents. The project demonstrates the ability to generate technical reports using **R Studio** with real data processing.

## Key Sections

1. **Objective**  
   The goal was to familiarize students with **R Markdown** to create well-formatted technical reports using dynamic documents.

2. **R Programming Language**  
   Overview of **R** as a programming language used for statistical computing and data visualization, widely used in spatial and environmental data analysis.

3. **R Markdown**  
   Explanation of **R Markdown** and its usage for creating formatted documents in **HTML**, **PDF**, and **Word** formats, with embedded R code.

4. **Data Used**  
   Data on methane exploration and extraction licenses from coal beds, retrieved from **Otwarte Dane** (Open Data). The data includes information on companies holding licenses, dates of issuance, and validity periods.

5. **Data Processing with dplyr**  
   The report shows step-by-step data manipulation using the **dplyr** package, focusing on tasks such as filtering, summarizing, and selecting columns.

6. **Results and Conclusions**  
   A summary of the analysis, focusing on how **R** and **R Markdown** can streamline the creation of dynamic reports, providing both text and code output.

## Output Format
